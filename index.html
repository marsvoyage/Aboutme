        <p>I'm someone who has many interests. Mathematically, I'm interested in any harmonic analysis branch that is connected
        to geometric inequalities or sparse analysis, and additive combinatorics and its continuous version. Currently I'm also self-learning mathematical data science (only in community detection and dimension reduction).
        Non-mathematically, I'm interested in web design - as you can see, I'm an amateur - and creating instant apps.</p>

        <div>
        <p>I'm mostly self-taught; my main mathematical background is in harmonic analysis. Please see my <a href="https://marsvoyage.github.io/RESUME/">RESUME</a> as well as my <a href="https://marsvoyage.github.io/Personalroadmap/">Personal road map</a> for more details.</p>
